**Omnisearch** is a search engine that "_just works_". It always instantly shows you the most relevant results, thanks to its smart weighting algorithm.

## Installation

- Omnisearch is available on [the official Community Plugins repository](https://obsidian.md/plugins?search=Omnisearch).
- Beta releases can be installed through [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat). **Be advised that those versions can be buggy and break things.**

> [!INFO] Chinese users
> If you have notes in Chinese, you should install [this additional plugin](https://github.com/aidenlx/cm-chs-patch) for better search results.
